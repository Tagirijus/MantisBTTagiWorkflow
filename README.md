# Mantis Bugtracker Tagi Workflow

## About

There are some things I changed in an older version of MantisBT to fit my workflow. But now I wanted to make things non-destructive and thus started to write a plugin to (hopefully) be able to achieve my workflow again, without the need of core-file modification.


## Example $g_category_tagi_stylize

array(
    'general' => 'color:red;font-weight:bold',
    'category 2' => 'color:grey',
)
