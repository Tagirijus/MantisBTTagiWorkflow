# Changelog

The following changelog is based on this: [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and tries to stick to the [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.2.0] - 2022-06-03
### Added
- Bugnote add player - feature added. This one can replace an url with a a-href HTML tag and an audio player at the same time.

## [1.1.0] - 2020-01-14
### Added
- Changelog added.
- Added feature to stylize the project list with a regex capturing. E.g. my project titles have the format "YYYY-MM Projecttitle" and I wanted the projecttitle to be more visible than the year and the month. Since I had no idea how to achieve this, I just added javascript, which captured a specific part of the project title and wrapped it with a `span` to be able to stilize this part.

### Changed
- README updated to make things more clear.

### Fixed
- Fixed some text in the plugins settings.
